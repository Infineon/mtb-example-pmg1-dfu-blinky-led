# EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU: DFU Blinky LED application

This example demonstrates the bootloadable application in basic device firmware update (DFU), also known as "bootloading", with the EZ-PD&trade; PMG1 MCU. 

This is a tiny application run by the CPU that blinks an LED at a 5-Hz rate continuously. This application transfers control to the bootloader when the user button is pressed.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br />

The following example will clone the "[DFU Bootloader](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-pmg1-dfu-blinky-led)" application with the desired name "MyBlinkyLED" configured for the *PMG1-CY7110* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id PMG1-CY7110 --app-id mtb-example-pmg1-dfu-blinky-led --user-app-name MyBlinkyLED --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br />

Following example adds the PMG1-CY7110 BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyBlinkyLED" --add-bsp-name PMG1-CY7110 --add-bsp-version "latest-v3.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyBlinkyLED" --set-active-bsp APP_PMG1-CY7110
   ```

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br />

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

## Operation

See the [README](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-pmg1-dfu-bootloader/blob/master/README.md) of the [mtb-example-pmg1-dfu-bootloader](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-pmg1-dfu-bootloader) code example for the details of firmware upgrade. After a successful firmware download by the DFU bootloader, the device will boot to *mtb-example-pmg1-dfu-blinky-led*. Observe the user LED blinking at 5 Hz.

### Switching between *bootloader* and *application*

Dynamic switching between the bootloader and the application is enabled with user button events. Press the user button to switch to the bootloader while the application is running. 

**Note:** Build the App0 (mtb-example-pmg1-dfu-bootloader) and App1 (mtb-example-pmg1-dfu-blinky-led) projects with the same toolchain. Application transfer may fail otherwise. Check the **Build Settings** for each project.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. Ensure that the board is connected to your PC using the USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector and the jumper shunt on power selection jumper (J5) is placed at position 1-2. Please refer to the "Debug mode" section in the kit user guide for debugging the application on CY7110 prototyping kit. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software User Guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

### Overview

This example demonstrates basic device firmware upgrade (DFU) Blinky LED application which blinks an LED at 5 Hz. It also allows dynamic switching to bootloader using button press events. 

### Memory layout

The first 24 KB is reserved for the bootloader. The size allocated to the application firmware can vary depending on the size of the flash available on the target device. The size of this Empty/Reserved region depends on the size of the flash available on the selected target device. See the respective device datasheets for details. The last 1-KB region of the flash is reserved for bootloader metadata.

To change the memory layout or usage, update the respective target linker script files. The linker scripts can also be modified to define dedicated regions of the memory for each application.

The RAM is shared by the bootloader and the Blinky applications, with a common area used by both projects.

### Software reset

When transferring control from one application to another, the recommended method is through a device software reset. This enables each application to initialize device hardware blocks and signal routing from a known state. It is possible to freeze the state of I/O pins so that they are maintained through a software reset. Defined portions of the SRAM are also maintained through a software reset. For more information, see the device-specific technical reference manual.
